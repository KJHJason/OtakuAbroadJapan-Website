          <img src="/multimedia/sub/AnimeRecommend/TsukiGaKirei.webp" alt="Tsuki Ga Kirei image scene" class="imgres" />
          <p>Tsuki ga Kirei or "As the Moon, So Beautiful" in English, is an adolescent romance story. Some may find it quite relatable too! It is a romance story between an aspiring writer Kotarou Azumi and a track team member Akane Mizuno who both ended up in the same class. They were both initially strangers but several opportunities brought them together.</p>
          <p>Personally, I think it is worth a watch! I find it especially wholesome to see the two characters experience love for the first time. You should give it a try if you like romance and/or wholesome anime!</p>

After their lifespan, they will have to be deactivated in order to avoid losing their memories and becoming a dangerous entity. Hence, the main characters are tasked as partners in the Terminal Service One to retrieve Giftias before their expiry date. Though in the process of it, they developed feelings for each other. However, nothing lasts forever as Isla's expiry date is near and Tsukasa has to come to terms with his feelings before then.</p>

To do that, Matsumoto is an AI from the future when the war broke out and time travelled 100 years back in time and met Vivy to carry out the "Singularity" project.</p>
          <p>This anime is definitely worth a watch if you are into the famous movie, Terminator and the game, Detroit: Become Human. The anime has a similar concept to those two movies and games. The songs in the anime are also quite good! Additionally, be warned when watching the anime, it can get quite bloody.</p>

Maquia is a member of a special race called the Iorph which are mystical beings who can live for hundreds of years.

However, the power-hungry kindom of Mezarte invades the homeland of Iorph and wanted to take away a selected few females of the Iorph community. They wanted to produce a hybrid of human and Iorph offspring to gain immortality. Maquia on the other hand was in the tower and was caught on a berserk Renato (A dragon basically) and stumbled onto a distant forest. She then finds a baby in a destroyed village and decided to take him in and named him Ariel.</p>
          <p>This anime will make you cry so prepare some tissues beside you. This anime is definitely worth a watch, and do note it is a movie and has a slow pace at the start. However, do watch till the end as the ending is the one that almost made me cried. It is basically an anime movie about a young girl who adopted a baby and struggles in life. Since Maquia is an Iorph who will live for hundreds of years, the adopted baby, Ariel is a human and will perish before her. You can guess where this is going but the movie is definitely worth a shot.</p>

          <p>Kanata no Astra is set in the year 2063 where space travel is feasible and commercially available. There are 9 main characters who are high school students about to go on a camping trip to the distant planet, McPa. However, upon reaching their campsite, a strange sphere, identical to a black hole, would suck them and they would end up somewhere lost in space.

Of course, there is a catch to this anime, someone among them caused the strange sphere to appear in an attempt to kill them somewhere in deep space.</p>
          <p>This anime is bascially similar to the game, "Among Us", and if you like the game concept, you would definitely like this anime.</p>

          <img src="/multimedia/sub/AnimeRecommend/AldnoahZero.webp" alt="Aldnoah.Zero fanart" class="imgres" />
          <p>This anime is about humanity who left Earth and lived on Mars that had advanced technology called, "Aldnoah", using a hypergate discovered on the moon which allowed teleportation to Mars. They then founded the Vers Empire of Mars and declared war against the Terrans (basically Earthlings in another word). However, a battle on the moon later called "Heaven's Fall", caused the hypergate to explode and destroyed the moon, leading the two planets to establish an uneasy ceasefire. Fifteen years later, the main character, Inaho Kaizuka who is a high school student witnesses the plotted assassination of the Vers Empire's Princess Asseylum Vers Allusiam, who visited Earth in hopes to repair the relationship between the empire and the Terrans. War then broke out.</p>
          <p>This anime story is quite good and has good original soundtracks in it. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you are into mecha anime and action.</p>

          <img src="/multimedia/sub/AnimeRecommend/Itsuwari_no_kamen.webp" alt="Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen game key visual" class="imgres" />
          <p>Do take note that Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen is the second season of the Utawarerumono series. Hence, I recommend that you watch the first season which is "Utawarerumono" from the year 2006 which is relatively an old anime. The first season can get quite boring as it is slow-paced but it is worth the wait! Now I will get to the synopsis of the anime, Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen, it revolves around the main character, Haku who was waking up cold and alone in the woods. He suffers from amnesia and was found by Kuon, a young girl with animal ears and a tail. She then brings him back to a nearby town and named him "Haku" as he does not remember his name. The story continues as Kuon and Haku ventured off to the capital of Yamato. Haku will then work to solve mysteries and try to stop a war from erupting among the nearby countries.</p>
          <p>This anime is mainly about action and drama, so if you are into action and drama movies, you would definitely love this anime!</p>

            <img src="/multimedia/sub/AnimeRecommend/SteinsGate.webp" alt="Stein;Gate key visual" class="imgres" />
            <p>Steins;Gate revolves around Rintarou Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist. He would usually conduct experiments with his group of friends in his rented room in an old building in Akihabara. He and his friends then accidentally made a time machine contraption that allowed him to send a "D-Mail", abbreviated for DeLorean Mail, which allowed Okabe to time travel with his memory intact. From time travelling, Okabe will face various troubles for sending a D-Mail with an organisation.</p>
            <p>If you like time travelling movies/anime, you would definitely want to give it a try. Although the story can be quite slow to pick up its pace, it is definitely worth the time to find out the ending of the anime.</p>
